# Use Stash

    git stash # stash your current work ( move your changes into a holding area for unfinished changes)
    git stash apply # retrieved your stashed work ( move your changes back into the current branch)
    git stash list # list your different stashes
    git apply stash@{1} # Apply stash #1
